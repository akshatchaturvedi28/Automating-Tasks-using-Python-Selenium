# Automating-Tasks-using-Python-Selenium
Our project aims to encourage and explore the world of automation through the use of two major programming languages and interfaces â€“ Python and Selenium. It explores the most popular libraries implemented by python to perform automation and file manipulation in recent years which include the OS, XML, urlparse and getpass libraries. It also explores selenium which is a free (open-source) automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms. It intends to create a tool-set driven by automation and web scraping.
